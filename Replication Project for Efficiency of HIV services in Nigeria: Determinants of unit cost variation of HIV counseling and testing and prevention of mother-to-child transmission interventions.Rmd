Total and Unit Cost Estimation

Where TCjk denotes the total annual cost of intervention j(1 = HCT, 2 = PMTCT) at facility
k. The term ICijkdenotes the annual cost of input category i(1 = personnel, 2 = recurrent
inputs and services, 3 = capital, and 4 = training), for intervention jat facility k.

1️⃣ Complexity of Services
HCT Services mainly include HIV testing and counseling, which require fewer medical resources.
PMTCT Services involve multiple interventions, including:
HIV testing for pregnant women
Provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART)
Monitoring and follow-ups
Nevirapine (NVP) treatment for infants
Delivery and postnatal care for HIV-positive mothers
PMTCT requires ongoing treatment and monitoring, whereas HCT is a one-time testing service for many clients.
2️⃣ Higher Cost of ART and Medication
PMTCT services include ARV (Antiretroviral Therapy) for HIV-positive mothers and newborns, which significantly increases costs.
HCT does not involve direct treatment—only testing and referral, which is much cheaper.
The cost of providing lifelong ART to a mother and her child is far greater than a single HIV test.
3️⃣ Additional Personnel Costs
PMTCT programs require more skilled health workers, such as obstetricians, pediatricians, and ART specialists, increasing personnel costs.
HCT primarily relies on nurses and counselors, which is a lower-cost workforce.
4️⃣ Infrastructure and Training Costs
PMTCT facilities require maternity services, ART dispensing units, and postnatal care, increasing infrastructure costs.
Training costs for PMTCT staff may be higher due to ART management, infant care, and adherence counseling.
5️⃣ Higher Operational Costs for PMTCT
PMTCT requires longer-term patient engagement, including follow-ups for mothers and infants.
Supply chain costs for PMTCT may be higher due to the distribution of ART drugs and maternal health supplements.



Compare Total Costs in NGN Before USD Conversion

HCT_filtered <- HCT_filtered %>%
  mutate(TC_USD = ln_tot_htc / exchange_rate)

# Ensure the attrition cascade condition is met
HCT_filtered <- HCT_filtered %>%
  mutate(
    qj11 = HTC_tes,    # Clients tested
    qj12 = HTC_pos,    # Clients tested & HIV-positive
    attrition_HCT = ifelse(qj11 >= qj12, TRUE, FALSE) # Check attrition condition

    qj21 = PMTCT_tes,    # Clients tested
    qj22 = PMTCT_pos,    # Clients tested & HIV-positive
    qj23 = PMTCT_art,    # HIV-positive clients receiving ARV
    qj24 = PMTCT_nvp,    # Infants born to HIV-positive clients receiving NVP
    attrition_PMTCT = ifelse(qj21 >= qj22 & qj22 >= qj23 & qj23 >= qj24, TRUE, FALSE) # Check attrition
  )

# Compute Unit Costs (UC) following the cascade structure
HCT_filtered <- HCT_filtered %>%
  mutate(
    UC_tested = TC_USD / qj11, # Cost per client tested
    UC_positive = ifelse(qj12 > 0, TC_USD / qj12, NA) # Cost per HIV-positive client
  )

PMTCT_filtered <- PMTCT_filtered %>%
  mutate(
    UC_tested = TC_USD / qj21, # Cost per client tested
    UC_positive = ifelse(qj22 > 0, TC_USD / qj22, NA), # Cost per HIV-positive client
    UC_ART = ifelse(qj23 > 0, TC_USD / qj23, NA), # Cost per HIV-positive client receiving ARV
    UC_NVP = ifelse(qj24 > 0, TC_USD / qj24, NA) # Cost per infant born to HIV-positive client receiving NVP
  )

# Display attrition check
print("Attrition Check for HCT:")

print("Attrition Check for PMTCT:")
table(PMTCT_filtered$attrition_PMTCT)

# Display computed unit costs
print("HCT Unit Costs:")
head(HCT_filtered %>% select(UC_tested, UC_positive))

print("PMTCT Unit Costs:")
head(PMTCT_filtered %>% select(UC_tested, UC_positive, UC_ART, UC_NVP))


```
The reason why UC ARTand UC NVP are the same is due to attrition patterns in the PMTCT cascade. If the number of HIV-positive women receiving ARV prophylaxis (q_{j23}) is equal to the number of infants receiving NVP (q_{j24}), then the unit cost calculations yield the same result. This finding reflects an efficient PMTCT service flow, where women who initiate ARV treatment are likely to continue care and deliver infants who subsequently receive NVP prophylaxis. However, any variation in these numbers across facilities could introduce some differences in unit costs.

```
UCijk→ Unit cost per output, i, per intervention; j, in facility k.
qijk: Number of clients served at each output leveli (clients tested, HIV-positive, ARV, NVP).

mjk → Years since the facility started HIV services (facility maturity).

ek → Average staff experience in years.

lck→ Facility's level of care (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary).

cjk→ Competence score of the facility.

tsjk→ Task shifting (binary: 1 = used, 0 = not used).

HIVjk→ Annual number of HIV clients (measure of integration).

ARTk → Binary indicator for ART provision.

Interpretation: 
Staff experience significantly increases costs in PMTCT.
tertiary care is significantly more expensive for HCT services.
ask shifting significantly reduces costs in PMTCT.
acility size and number of clients have no strong non-linear cost effects.
RT provision does not significantly affect unit costs.

```
In the article (I checked the footnotes and methodology):
Sample weighting was applied to compute nationally representative estimates.
They used weighted averages, not simple means.
The reason caused the difference: In the article, sample size n decreases with each step of the cascade due to attrition:
Not all facilities report infant-level data.
Some facilities report ART data, some do not.
My data set may not perfectly follow this attrition pattern unless further filtered.

Different Data Cleaning and Exclusion Criteria
The paper excluded implausible or incomplete records (e.g., outliers, missing time-motion data, extreme unit costs).
my replication likely includes all rows with non-missing values, so:
I might include small clinics with low output or odd costs.
This can lower the weighted mean and increase the SD.

✅ 2. Weighting Method
The paper used nationally representative weights based on the full sample.
My code uses weights from just the filtered data, not the full denominator 
This causes slightly different weighted means.

✅ 3. PPP Adjustment
The original authors may have used official exchange rates or World Bank PPP factors.
I was using approximated PPP factors (e.g., 22/13 ≈ 1.69) reverse-engineered from the paper.
So my PPP-adjusted costs are close but not exact.

✅ 4. Potential Hidden Transformations
The authors may have done cost smoothing, trimming outliers, or winsorizing (e.g., capping extreme values).
I was using raw exponentiated costs, which may include high variance.
